# MovieRental

## About this project
This project has been developed for the Software eng 3 course. Its objective is to show how the MVC architectural pattern works in Android Development. The Layout is made more simply possible due to the deadline for this task.

## Tech Stack
- Room, for local database
- Coroutines, for async
- Important note: Was a requirement of the Teacher, not to use ViewBinding.
